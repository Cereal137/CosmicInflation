This is the python code to simulate cosmic inflation

Now the code has finished the simple model and added features of more sophisticated models.

Run ode.ipynb for results.

For developer, you can configure global parameters in config.ini

inflation models are stored as modules in src/model

as well as plot module and ode module.

For specific model, you may find its python file in src/model to change its default parameters.

You can add new models in the same directory, as long as you have the same name as the configure file input.

simply run inflation.py to simulate cosmic inflation.
